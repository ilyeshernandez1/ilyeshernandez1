 # Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
> *I'm Ilyes, a 15-year-old developer from France.*

## About 
I'm passionate about coding and love building projects that make a difference. Living in France, I enjoy using technology to create cool things that help our community. I'm a fan of open-source projects, as long as I can decipher the code! 

## Tech Stack
In my toolbox, you'll find Rust for CLI and system tasks, TypeScript for web development, and SvelteKit or React (NextJS) for building web applications. When it comes to APIs, I turn to AdonisJS. Simple, right?

## More about me
Beyond coding, I share my thoughts through articles, particularly on TypeScript and other interesting topics. If you want check it, go [here](https://medium.com/@ilyeshernandez.apple). I never post any article right now but maybe later.
